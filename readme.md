# cv-examples

This repo contains a collection of computer vision examples in JavaScript for use in the browser.

You can preview the examples [here](https://kylemcdonald.github.io/cv-examples/).

## Setup

Clone this repository or download the zip, then run the [p5 Editor](http://p5js.org/download/). In the p5 Editor, click `File > Open` and navigate to `cv-examples/` and select `index.html`. Click the play button, and this should launch the browser with links to each of the sketches.

If you run one of the sketches by itself, it might not work because it is including some functions from `../shared/utils.js`.
